I got one review...

Hi Amanda,

Overall for your website, I do not see anything that really needs changing. 
The color scheme is good, and the layout is also really good. 
The navbar doesn't take up that much room, but I imagine that is intentional, 
so more recipes can be added.
** I made the nav bar spaced evenly 

That being said, there were two small things that I think you could benefit from. 
For starters, the text on the pages of the recipes themselves seems too compact, 
and I think it would really benefit from being spaced a bit more. 
** I changed the font and I added a border around this section

Additionally, the picture at the bottom of the scones just seems a little 
bit out of place, and I think it could benefit from some additional 
formatting to make it fit in better. 
** I reduced the size of the picture
